This HUGE monster pack includes all sorts of monster sounds from a wide selection of different creatures.  Dragons, Giants, Lizard Monsters, Orcs, Skeletons, Werewolves, Goblins, Gnolls, Fire Monsters, Ghouls and so on.
You will hear those creatures growl, scream, talk, fight, bite, attack, spit fire, fly, walk, kill, die and more.

Note that all the sounds in this library are made from scratch and have all been created by myself. For this album, I did a lot of voice recordings, and studio recordings for the impact and bite sounds. The better part of the work was to assemble the recordings and applying various effects on the voices, to make these creatures come alive! The final sound effects are the result of a lot of tweaking, thorough mixing and creative sounds design work.

Check out these videos featuring some of the Monster sounds and Atmospheres you will find in the Pack:
